## Results for Removing Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

## Index of the First Occurrence in a String
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

## Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Length of Last Word
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, `return` the length of the last word in the `string`.

A word is a maximal `substring` consisting of non-space characters only.

## Plus One

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

## Add Binary

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a `binary` string.

## Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
    - For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

## Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Lists

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

## Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Convert Sorted Array into Binary Tree

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced binary search tree.
